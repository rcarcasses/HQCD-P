\chapter{Introduction}
This is a manual that helps the user to use our tool. The objective is the user to choose his/her favourite model and comparing it with the available scattering data.

\chapter{HQCDP Class}
In order to fit the holographic model of QCD we need first to create a HQCDP object. Here we describe the functions of this class and provide examples of how to use them.
